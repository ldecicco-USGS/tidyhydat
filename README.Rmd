Here is a list of what `tidyhydat` does:
  
- Provide function that access each tables in the HYDAT database and return tidy data.
- Keep functions are low-level as possible. For example, for daily flows, the `DLY_FLOWS()` function queries the database, *tidies* the data and returns the data. 
- Provide functions that access Environment and Climate Change Canada's real-time hydrometric data source. 
- Provide functions that search full station lists and aid in generating station vectors
  
A more thorough vignette outlining the full functionality of `tidyhydat` is outlined [here](https://github.com/bcgov/tidyhydat/blob/master/vignettes/tidyhydat.Rmd)
  
## Installation
To install the `tidyhydat` package, you need to install the `devtools` package then the `tidyhydat` package
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/tidyhydat")
```
  
Then to load the package you need to using the `library()` function. When you install `tidyhydat`, several other packages will be installed as well. One of those packages, `dplyr`, is useful for data manipulations and is used regularly here. Even though `dplyr` is installed alongside `tidyhydat`, it is helpful to load it by itself as there are many useful functions contained within `dplyr`. A helpful `dplyr` tutorial can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html).
  
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyhydat)
library(dplyr)
```
  
### HYDAT download
To use most of the `tidyhydat` package you will need the most recent version of the HYDAT database, Environment and Climate Change Canada's comprehensive database of historical hydrometric data. A zipped version of sqlite3 version can be downloaded here:
  
- http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/hydrometrics/www/
  
`tidyhydat` also provides a convenience function to download hydat (be patient though this takes a long time!):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
download_hydat(dl_hydat_here = "H:/")
```
  
However you download it, the path to the sqlite3 must be specified within each function that uses HYDAT; you need tell `tidyhydat` where the HYDAT database. One option to is enter the path in each function like this:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
STATIONS(hydat_path = "H:/Hydat.sqlite3")
```
It will quickly get tiring manually entering `hydat_path = `. R provides a means setting a hydat path once in the `.Renviron` file which is then automatically called by each HYDAT function. In R you can open up `.Renviron` like this:
```{r, eval= FALSE, echo = TRUE}
file.edit("~/.Renviron")
```
This opens your `.Renviron` file which may be a blank file. Add this line somewhere in the file:
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
hydat = "YOUR HYDAT PATH"
```
It is important that you name the variable `hydat` as that is name of the variable that the functions are looking for. 

## Usage

### HYDAT functions
All functions that interact with HYDAT are capitalized. These functions follow a common argument structure which can be illustrated with the `DLY_FLOWS()` function. If you would like to extract only station `08LA001` you can supply the `STATION_NUMBER`. The `hydat_path` argument is omitted here and it is assumed you set the variable in your `.Renviron` file which is highly recommend. 
  
```{r example1, warning=FALSE}
DLY_FLOWS(STATION_NUMBER = "08LA001")
```

If you would instead prefer all stations from a province, you can use the `PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC` argument and omit the `STATION_NUMBER` argument:
  
```{r example2, warning=FALSE}
DLY_FLOWS(PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC = "PE")
```

### Real-time
To download real-time data using the datamart we can use approximately the same conventions discussed above. Using `download_realtime_dd()` we can easily select specific stations by supplying a station of interest:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
download_realtime_dd(STATION_NUMBER = "08LG006")
```
Another option is to provide simply the province as an argument and download all stations from that province:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
download_realtime_dd(PROV_TERR_STATE_LOC = "PE")
```
Additionally `download_realtime_ws()` provides another means of acquiring real time data though that requires a username and password from Environment and Climate Change Canada.

### Search functions
You can also make use of auxiliary functions in `tidyhdyat` called `search_name()` and `search_number()` to look for matches when you know part of a name of a station. For example:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
search_name("liard")
```
Similarly, `search_number()` can be useful if you are interested in all stations from the *08MF* sub-sub-drainage:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
search_number("08MF")
```
